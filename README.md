# Ballistic Simulation

A Python-based ballistic simulation designed to analyze projectile motion, energy dissipation, and interactions with various mediums such as air, armor, and tissue. This project is modular and extensible, making it suitable for physics research and educational purposes.

## Features

- Simulates projectile motion with drag forces.
- Models bullet interaction with:
  - Air (energy loss due to drag).
  - Armor (penetration, deformation, and energy absorption).
  - Tissue (terminal ballistics).
- Visualizes energy distribution across mediums using pie charts.
- Modular design with classes for bullet, weapon, medium, armor, and simulation logic.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yapicik/ballistic-simulation.git
